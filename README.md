# MONAD

Key Improvements Explained:
1. Improved Configuration Management

Added a dedicated validateConfig() function to check for required environment variables
Better parsing of environment variables (ensuring numeric types where needed)
Improved config loading and saving with proper error handling
Added filtering for empty wallet keys
2. Enhanced Error Handling

Comprehensive try-catch blocks throughout the code
Detailed error logging with context
Proper handling of channel message failures
Error handling for the Telegram bot's polling
3. Better BigInt Operations

Fixed balance comparison using proper BigInt operations
Added human-readable balance display in error messages
Proper handling of gas cost calculations
4. Improved Bot Functionality

Added a new /status command to check bot configuration
Enhanced message formatting with Markdown for better readability
Better command responses with more detailed information
Improved authorization checks for admin-only commands
5. Proper Asynchronous Operations

Sequential processing of wallets with delays to prevent rate limiting
Proper async/await patterns throughout the code
Added delays between operations to avoid potential issues
6. Better Code Structure

Separated initialization and functionality into clear functions
Added proper validation before contract initialization
Better organization of bot commands
Added a health endpoint for monitoring
7. Optional Gas Estimation

Added commented-out gas estimation code that can be enabled if needed
This helps optimize gas usage but requires the contract to be deployed
8. Enhanced Security

Better validation of user inputs
Proper handling of private keys (adding '0x' prefix if missing)
No logging of sensitive information
Usage Instructions:
1. Dependencies
First, ensure you have all the required dependencies:

Copynpm install web3 node-telegram-bot-api express dotenv
2. Environment Variables
Create a .env file with the following variables:

RPC_URL=https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz
EXPLORER_URL=https://testnet.monadexplorer.com/tx/
CHAIN_ID=10143
GAS_LIMIT=500000
GAS_PRICE=52000000000
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
ADMIN_IDS=6668515216
CHANNEL_ID=@your_channel
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
WALLETS=privateKey1,privateKey2
3. Running the Bot
Start the bot with:

Copynode bot.js
4. Bot Commands
/mint - Mint NFTs from all configured wallets
/setcontract <address> - Set contract address
/setchannel <channel> - Set notification channel
/balance - Check all wallet balances
/status - Show current bot configuration
/help - Show help message
5. Security Considerations
Never commit your .env file to version control
Store your private keys securely
Consider using a secrets manager for production deployments
Only add trusted users to the ADMIN_IDS list
This improved implementation provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly Telegram bot for interacting with Monad blockchain contracts, specifically for minting NFTs. The code is now more resilient to errors, better organized, and includes helpful new features while maintaining the core functionality of the original implementation.
